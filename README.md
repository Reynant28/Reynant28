# Hey there! 👋

I'm [Reyva](mailto:reyvaaafarysta@gmail.com), a developer from Indonesia.

I love building systems that actually work APIs, databases, server logic, and anything that happens behind the scenes.
Right now, I'm mainly working with Laravel, but I'm slowly expanding into other backend ecosystems like Express and maybe even Next.js later on.

If something sparks my curiosity, I'll probably turn it into a project.
So far, I've built apps using Laravel, React + Laravel, and Kotlin.

⚙️ Tech Stack I Enjoy

Backend: Laravel, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL (currently learning this)

Frontend: React 

Mobile: Kotlin

Soon Exploring: Express, Next.js

📌 Projects

I’ve built several full-stack and backend-heavy apps, and more are on the way.
(You’ll probably see them pinned below!)

🌱 What I'm Learning Next

Improving my backend foundations, exploring new frameworks, and leveling up my full-stack skills step by step.
